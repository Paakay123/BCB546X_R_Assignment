str()

col_names()

names(x), dim(x), and class(x), not attr(x, "names"), attr(x, "dim"), and attr(x, "class").

sapply(snp_known, class)

summary() and summarize()

PARSE!!

as.data.frame()
typeof()

snp_crop <- select(snp_position, SNP_ID, Chromosome, Position)
snp_known <- filter(snp_position, Chromosome != "multiple", Chromosome != "unknown", Position != "multiple")


Type, typeof(), what it is.
Length, length(), how many elements it contains.
Attributes, attributes(), additional arbitrary metadata.


dim() - returns the dimensions of data frame (i.e. number of rows and number of columns)
nrow() - number of rows
ncol() - number of columns
str() - structure of data frame - name, type and preview of data in each column
names() - shows the names attribute for a data frame, which gives the column names.
sapply(dataframe, class) - shows the class of each column in the data frame

for (i in 1:length(ll)) {print(mean(ll[[i]]))}
lapply(list,sum)

Hi


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
